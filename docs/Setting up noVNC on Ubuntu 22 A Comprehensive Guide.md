## 1. Update System Packages

First, ensure your system is up to date:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

## 2. Install VNC Server

Install TightVNC server:

```bash
sudo apt install tightvncserver
```

Set up a VNC password:

```bash
vncserver
```

You'll be prompted to enter and confirm a password.

## 3. Install Desktop Environment

Install Xfce, a lightweight desktop environment that works well with VNC:

```bash
sudo apt install xfce4 xfce4-goodies
```

## 4. Configure VNC Server

Create or edit the VNC startup script:

```bash
nano ~/.vnc/xstartup
```

Add the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
xrdb "$HOME/.Xresources"
xsetroot -solid grey
#x-terminal-emulator -geometry 80x24+10+10 -ls -title "$VNCDESKTOP Desktop" &
#x-window-manager &
# Fix to make GNOME work
export XKL_XMODMAP_DISABLE=1
/etc/X11/Xsession
xrdb $HOME/.Xresources
startxfce4 &
xfce4-terminal &
```

Make the file executable:

```bash
chmod +x ~/.vnc/xstartup
```

## 5. Install noVNC

Clone the noVNC repository:

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/novnc/noVNC.git
```

Create a self-signed SSL certificate for HTTPS connections:

```bash
cd noVNC
openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -out self.pem -keyout self.pem
```

## 6. Create Startup Scripts

Create a startup script for noVNC:

```bash
nano ~/start_novnc.sh
```

Add the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
~/noVNC/utils/novnc_proxy --vnc localhost:5901 --listen 8443
```

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x ~/start_novnc.sh
```

## 7. Set Up Systemd Services

Create a systemd service file for the VNC server:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/vncserver@.service
```

Add the following content:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Start VNC server at startup
After=syslog.target network.target

[Service]
Type=forking
User=YOUR_USERNAME
Group=YOUR_USERNAME
WorkingDirectory=/home/YOUR_USERNAME

PIDFile=/home/YOUR_USERNAME/.vnc/%H:%i.pid
ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/vncserver -kill :%i > /dev/null 2>&1
ExecStart=/usr/bin/vncserver :%i
ExecStop=/usr/bin/vncserver -kill :%i

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual username.

Create a systemd service file for noVNC:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/novnc.service
```

Add the following content:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=noVNC Proxy Service
After=network.target vncserver@1.service
Requires=vncserver@1.service

[Service]
Type=simple
User=YOUR_USERNAME
ExecStart=/home/YOUR_USERNAME/start_novnc.sh
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=3

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Again, replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual username.

Enable and start the services:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable vncserver@1.service
sudo systemctl enable novnc.service
sudo systemctl start vncserver@1.service
sudo systemctl start novnc.service
```

## 8. Firewall Configuration

If you're using UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall), allow the noVNC port:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 8443/tcp
```

## 9. Connecting to Your noVNC Server

Open a web browser and navigate to:

```
https://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8443/vnc.html
```

Replace `YOUR_SERVER_IP` with your server's IP address or hostname. If you're on the same machine, you can use `localhost`.

Click "Connect" and enter your VNC password when prompted.

## 10. Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, here are some steps to check the status and troubleshoot:

1. Check service status:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status vncserver@1.service
   sudo systemctl status novnc.service
   ```
   This will show whether the services are active (running) or inactive (stopped).

2. View service logs:
   ```bash
   journalctl -u vncserver@1.service
   journalctl -u novnc.service
   ```
   These commands will display the logs for each service, which can help identify any errors.

3. Ensure ports are open:
   ```bash
   sudo ss -tulpn | grep -E '5901|8443'
   ```
   This will show if the VNC (5901) and noVNC (8443) ports are listening.

4. Check VNC server logs:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.vnc/*.log
   ```
   This will display the VNC server logs, which may contain error messages or warnings.

5. Check if the VNC process is running:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep vnc
   ```
   This will show all processes related to VNC.

6. Verify the contents of the xstartup file:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.vnc/xstartup
   ```
   Ensure that the content matches the startup script provided earlier.

7. Check system logs for any related errors:
   ```bash
   sudo tail -n 100 /var/log/syslog | grep -i vnc
   ```
   This will show the last 100 lines of the system log, filtered for VNC-related entries.

8. Test VNC connection locally:
   ```bash
   vncviewer localhost:5901
   ```
   This will attempt to connect to the VNC server locally, which can help isolate network-related issues.

9. Verify noVNC proxy is running:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep novnc_proxy
   ```
   This will show if the noVNC proxy process is active.

10. Check for any error messages in the noVNC browser console:
    Open your browser's developer tools (usually F12) and look in the console tab for any error messages when trying to connect to noVNC.

If problems persist after checking these items, consider the following steps:

- Restart the VNC and noVNC services:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart vncserver@1.service
  sudo systemctl restart novnc.service
  ```

- Reboot your system and try again:
  ```bash
  sudo reboot
  ```

- Ensure all necessary packages are installed and up to date:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt upgrade
  sudo apt install --reinstall tightvncserver xfce4 xfce4-goodies
  ```

Remember to keep your system updated and regularly check for any security advisories related to VNC and noVNC. If you continue to experience issues, consider reviewing your firewall settings and ensuring that your network allows connections to the necessary ports.
